AutoMod
-
AutoMod is a IRC bot written in python to assist moderators and server admins in moderating their channels and having an easy set of commands to take the hassle out of syntax errors and issues. AutoMod is free for everyone to use, and if you think there should be something added, feel free to join the project.

This IRC Bot is originally being made for the 123 Free Chat network, but anyone is more than welcome to use it.
